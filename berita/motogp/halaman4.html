    <h1>Halaman 4 - MOTO GP</h1>
    <h3>Dovizioso: the attendance king</h3>
    <p align="right">
      The Italian, along with teammate Jorge Lorenzo, has been competing on the
      <br />
      World stage for 16 straight years — the third highest on the grid behind
      <br />
      Valentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) and Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda
      <br />
      Team). It's a huge testament to the 32-year-old, who in the last two years
      has <br />
      been — on paper - Marc Marquez' (Repsol Honda Team) most consistent <br />
      challenger.
